# Poissons-equation
I used Hooke's law to solve any field equation. Just give it initial contitions, boundary conditions, and you can put any conservative field inside it as well.
<br />
Solves Laplace equation, Poissons equation, wave equation, heat equation, field equations, and customize the boundaries/initial conditions to be whatever functions you want. <br />
You could vibrate a point in the middle if you want, pulse points along the boundary, throw electrons around. The limits are your imagination.<br />
Use arrows, "W" and "S" to move around. It uses my 3d conversion file to plot the 3d points on a 2d 1920x1080 plane
